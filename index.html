<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In 2018, Wellspring undertook a grantee survey around non-financial assistance. Some of you expressed strong interest in some topics, but not others. There was not a topic on the survey that did not receive strong interest from at least some of you. Therefore, we created this site to provide resources around all topics, knowing that  will be at varying levels of knowledge and capacity around these topics; the resources here are tailored toward the __ end of the spectrum. For more information or to request further assistance on any of these topics, please contact your program officer.</p>

<h4>Support WPF Can Offer</h4>
<p>Wellspring would like to support your organization as you work to strengthen the security and safety of your staff.  Below are a few possible resources we can offer and/or connect you with:</p>
<h5>WPF Security Consultant</h5>
<p>Wellspring works closely with a security advisor, Alex Carle, who is available to provide confidential and no-cost security guidance via phone, email, or Skype. We are happy to send an email introduction. Though he is based in London, Alex travels regularly and was for many years the Africa Security Advisor for Care International, based in Nairobi.  He is very quick to respond to emails and has a lot of helpful advice.</p>
<h5>Organizations that Provide Emergency Security Support</h5>
<p>As part of our work with other donors concerned about safety threats, the Human Rights Funders Network has developed a Directory of Emergency/Rapid Response Grants and a directory of Rest and Respite Programs. The directories contain grant guidelines and contact information for international organizations that support emergency HRD responses. </p>

<p>The European Commission provides small grants up to 10,000 euros for human rights defenders at risk. More information can be found on their website or by contacting your program officer who has a copy of the grant form you would need to submit. </p>

<p>The Digital Defenders Partnership provides 1) Emergency grants to Internet users facing urgent digital threats; 2) Grants for organizations seeking to improve their digital security apparatus, setting up temporary help desks or testing and researching specific threats, and 3) strategic grants to NGOs to strengthen their digital security over the longer-term. </p>

<p>Access Now runs a digital security Helpline that offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to activists, independent media, and civil society organizations, including: 24/7 emergency response, personalized recommendations, instruction, and follow-up support, guidance on security tools, support for securing technical infrastructure, websites, and social media, in-person consultations, including referrals, mitigation, capacity-building, and training, and resource materials in multiple languages. The Helpline can be contacted at the email: help@accessnow.org. </p>

<p>If a grantee believes they have been hacked by an adversary, or otherwise targeted with a digital attack and would like to understand the source of the attack, Citizen Lab researches information controls. This is not emergency support, but can help the broader field understand who the adversary is and how they are targeting human rights defenders.

 </p>
<h5>East and Horn Region</h5>
<p>The East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project works to ensure that HRDs receive the necessary support to mitigate the risks that they face and continue their work. You can contact them at protection@defenddefenders.org and they will assess your case. You can also contact them using a secure contact form found here or here. </p>
<h5>Uganda</h5>
<h5>Tanzania</h5>

  <h3>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
  <p>Data can be an important component of other focus areas on this website. Field data collection and analysis to inform evaluation and learning, effective data visualization as an advocacy tool, and  are all examples of ways an organization's data capacity can advance other capacity areas.</p>

<h4>Start Here</h4>
<p>Organizations at different levels of data maturity face different barriers.
For those on the less mature end of the spectrum, it can to be a combination of gaps in awareness,
skills, data quality, and analysis tools. Sometimes it’s about
the attitude and willingness of leaders; and sometimes it’s about not
having the capacity/resources to move beyond the data requirements
being externally dictated by funders and boards. Starting with an assessment of data maturity can be a helpful place to start by identifying current strengths and areas to focus on for improvement. Two such assessments are provided below. </p>

<h4>Additional Support</h4>
<p>Please contact your program officer if you would like additional support around data collection and use. If your oganization already has data and needs help with the analysis piece, we can make an introduction to DataKind, which provides pro bono data science assistance to mission-driven organizations.</p>
