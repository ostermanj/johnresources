<h1>Security: Staff Safety and Cybersecurity</h1>
        
<p>Wellspring is committed to supporting organizations to be as secure as they can be (and striving to being as secure as possible ourselves). We take a holistic view of security, encompassing physical, travel, and digital security, as well as overall well-being. The list of resources below contains two short checklists developed by Wellspring staff and a security consultant, plus an online assessment that provides personalized online security recommendations.</p>

                <h2>Additional Support WPF Can Offer</h2>
              
                <p>Wellspring works closely with a security advisor, who is available to provide confidential and no-cost security guidance via phone, email, or Skype. We are happy to send an email introduction. </p>
                <p>In addition, there are a number of organizations we work with that provide emergency/rapid response grants, support for human rights defenders at risk, grants and training to organizations looking to strengthen their digital security, and support to organizations that believe they may have been hacked. Please contact your program officer if any of these could be useful to your organization.</p>
