                <h2>Support WPF Can Offer</h2>
                <p>Wellspring would like to support your organization as you work to strengthen the security and safety of your staff.  Below are a few possible resources we can offer and/or connect you with:</p>
                <h4>WPF Security Consultant</h4>
                <p>Wellspring works closely with a security advisor, who is available to provide confidential and no-cost security guidance via phone, email, or Skype. We are happy to send an email introduction. </p>
                <h4>Organizations that Provide Emergency Security Support</h4>
                <p>As part of our work with other donors concerned about safety threats, the Human Rights Funders Network has developed a Directory of Emergency/Rapid Response Grants and a directory of Rest and Respite Programs. The directories contain grant guidelines and contact information for international organizations that support emergency HRD responses. </p>

                <p>The European Commission provides small grants up to 10,000 euros for human rights defenders at risk. More information can be found on their website or by contacting your program officer who has a copy of the grant form you would need to submit. </p>

                <p>The Digital Defenders Partnership provides 1) Emergency grants to Internet users facing urgent digital threats; 2) Grants for organizations seeking to improve their digital security apparatus, setting up temporary help desks or testing and researching specific threats, and 3) strategic grants to NGOs to strengthen their digital security over the longer-term. </p>

                <p>Access Now runs a digital security Helpline that offers real-time, direct technical assistance and advice to activists, independent media, and civil society organizations, including: 24/7 emergency response, personalized recommendations, instruction, and follow-up support, guidance on security tools, support for securing technical infrastructure, websites, and social media, in-person consultations, including referrals, mitigation, capacity-building, and training, and resource materials in multiple languages. The Helpline can be contacted at the email: help@accessnow.org. </p>

                <p>If a grantee believes they have been hacked by an adversary, or otherwise targeted with a digital attack and would like to understand the source of the attack, Citizen Lab researches information controls. This is not emergency support, but can help the broader field understand who the adversary is and how they are targeting human rights defenders.

                </p>
