<h2>Data Collection and Analysis</h3>
                  <p>Data can be an important component of other focus areas on this website. Field data collection and analysis to inform evaluation and learning, effective data visualization as an advocacy tool, and  are all examples of ways an organization's data capacity can advance other capacity areas.</p>

            <p>Organizations at different levels of data maturity face different barriers.
              For those on the less mature end of the spectrum, it can to be a combination of gaps in awareness,
              skills, data quality, and analysis tools. Sometimes it’s about
              the attitude and willingness of leaders; and sometimes it’s about not
              having the capacity/resources to move beyond the data requirements
            being externally dictated by funders and boards. Starting with an assessment of data maturity can be a helpful place to start by identifying current strengths and areas to focus on for improvement. Two such assessments are provided below. </p>
