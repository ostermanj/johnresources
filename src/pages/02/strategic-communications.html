<h1>Communications to Advance Your Work</h1>
            <p>We realize strategic communications may look quite different in different contexts. Therefore, the resources provivded here aim to cover basic universal concepts, with more specific applicability noted where that is the case.</p>

          <h2> Additional Support and Resources WPF Can Provide</h2>
          <p>Wellspring has a working group focused on supporting grantees internationally (especially in East Africa and to some extent in Latin America) to research, test, and/or evaluate communications that target specific audiences and seek to change knowledge, attitudes, and/or behaviours related to particular social justice issues. The working group has created a newsletter of free resources and references that might be of interest (an example of the newsletter can be seen <a href='/assets/resources/CommsNewsletter.pdf' target="_blank">here</a>). Please contact your program officer if you would like to be put in touch with the working group and/or be added to the list that receives the newsletter.</p>
