<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2018, Wellspring undertook a grantee survey around non-financial assistance. Some of you expressed strong interest in some topics, but not others. There was not a topic on the survey that did not receive strong interest from at least some of you. Therefore, we created this site to provide resources around all topics, knowing that will be at varying levels of knowledge and capacity around these topics; the resources here are tailored toward the __ end of the spectrum. For more information or to request further assistance on any of these topics, please contact your program officer.</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
