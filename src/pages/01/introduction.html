<h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Recognizing that our grantees are very diverse and no set of resources could possibly be applicable to all, the resources on this site are aimed at an introductory level; the kinds of things that might be useful to an organization just starting to think about a given topic. Some of you will be at much more advanced stages. Wherever you are on a given topic, please dont hesitate to reach out to your program officer if you would like to have a more in depth conversation around how we may be able to provide support.</p>
                <p>The results of the first survey question are below. As each topic received at least a third of respondents rating additional resources as 'very useful,' we have included resources on all topics. Navigate to each of them using the menu on the right.</p>
