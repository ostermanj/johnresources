<h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>First, thank you for providing feedback on the survey. Your input is valuable as we work to become a better funder. Recognizing that our grantee partners are very diverse and no set of resources could possibly be applicable to all, the resources on this site are aimed at an introductory level; the kinds of things that might be useful to an organization just starting to think about a given topic. Some of you have been thinking about these topics for a long time, are the true experts, and therefore may not find anything new. Wherever you are on a given topic, please dont hesitate to reach out to your program officer if you would like to have a more in depth conversation around how we may be able to provide additional support.</p>
                <p>The results of the first survey question are below. As each topic received at least a third of respondents rating additional resources as 'very useful,' we have included resources on all topics. Navigate to each of them using the menu on the right.</p>
